# Making Raspberry Pi usable

After 3 months of using RPi, I decided to make this tutorial for same people as I'm - who looks for easy, understandable way to make RPi as awesome as possible.

In this tutorial I will walk you through whole process of making from Raspberry Pi secure, reliable, efficient, fast and easy to maintain server for variable purpouses as is FTP, web hosting, sharing... All that thanks to Archlinux ARM operating system. The device will be "headless" - it means, there will be no fancy windows etc., just command line. Don't be scared, I will walk you through and you'll thank me then :) .

## What you get on when you succesfully finish
From "bare" RPi you'll get: 

* Possibility to connect to your RPi from anywhere
* Possibility of hosting web pages, files, etc.
* Readable and reliable system (it will do what you want and nothing more)

## What you will need
* Raspberry Pi (doesn't matter which model) with power supply
* SD Card as a main hardisk for RPi
* Ethernet LAN cable or USB wifi bundle
* Other computer (preferably with linux, but nevermind if you use Windows or Mac)
* Possibility to physically get to your router and know credentials to login to it (or have contact to your network administrator :) )
* Few hours
