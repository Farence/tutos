Introduction
============

Who am I?
----------

I'm student of technical university in Czech republic and one of my hobbies is IT. I'm user of Archlinux on my laptop and I'm also running small home server hosting several websites of my friends and myself. 

Everything I've learned I've learned on the internet, which is full of great guides and tips. But sometimes it was really stressful - 10 different guides from different authors on different versions of specific software.

There is also missing bridge between guides for beginners (or **normal** users) and for professionals. Unfortunately for me I'm somewhere middle of this two groups.

What are these guides about
----------------------------

So I decided to write guides for this **middle** class. In these guides I'm going to cover several topics as it's comming to my mind.

Main areas of these guides are:

* Linux (mainly Archlinux)
* systemd (I'm happy user :) )
* Raspberry Pi
* Configuration of server
* Domains, IP addresses, redirecting

Some remarks
------------

When I feel that some topic is covered solidly somewhere else, I will
redirect you there. So think about this also as summary of available materials.

Somewhere is neccessary to know some basics about linux and terminal. I'll try to remark them.
 
Sometimes I might be improper in explaining some terms or details. This might be mainly because of two reasons:

1. I don't understand enough to explain it better  
2. It's not neccessary you to know it for our purpouse

I hope I'll be able to explain all things somehow *human-likely*. If you want to know technical details, just find them on your own :) .

On github repository of this `guide <https://github.com/Farence/tutos>`_ you can find some of my configs from both of my machines - laptop which I use as a work station and for fun and RPi which is server for several of my websites, FTP, ssh...

One extremely important remark - **USE GOOGLE**!

My english
-----------

My english isn't great, but I believe it's good enough to understand what I'm trying to explain.

Feedback
--------

I'll be really happy for you feedback - don't hesitate to ask about some additional info or next guides and also if you find some mistakes, please let me know.

Both can be done by submiting an issue on github, where are these guides placed.
